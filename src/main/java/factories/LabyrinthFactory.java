 * Note in the book that LabyrinthFactory is not an abstract class; thus it
 * acts as both the AbstractFactory and the ConcreteFactory. That is
 * another common implementation for simple applications of the
 * Abstract Factory pattern. Because the LabyrinthFactory is a concrete class
 * consisting entirely of factory methods, itâ€™s easy to make a new
 * LabyrinthFactory by making a subclass and overriding the operations that
 * need to change.
